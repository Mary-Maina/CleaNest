# CleaNest Website
## Introduction
CleaNest is a React and Django Website. The project offers to connect users with professional cleaners for a variety of home cleaning services. It offers a user-friendly interface for booking appointments, secure payments, and real-time communication with cleaners. We aim to provide a convenient and reliable solution for home cleaning needs. The target market for the app is homeowners, busy individuals, renters, Airbnb owners, and people preparing their houses for sale. This application is a part of my portfolio project for the ALX Software Engineering Programme (Cohort 22).
